<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Frank, but you can call me Frankie—your friendly neighborhood curious mind!</p>

<p>Hailing from a quaint village in Nigeria, I’ve always had a knack for uncovering the mysteries of how things tick. My insatiable curiosity often led me down a path of exploration (and a few mishaps) as I’d take things apart, only to find myself scratching my head over how to piece them back together.</p>

<p>This adventurous spirit is what ignited my passion for becoming an electrician. Under the guidance of an incredible mentor, I dove deep into the world of electrical installations, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Each spark of knowledge fueled my desire to learn more!</p>

<p>But why stop there? That same curiosity has now propelled me into the exciting realm of programming! It’s been an exhilarating journey where I not only get to decode the behavior of computers but also write my own commands and bring ideas to life through code.</p>

<p>So, join me as I share my unique perspective as an electrician turned programmer. Together, we’ll explore innovative projects, tackle challenges, and discover the fascinating intersection of electrical engineering and coding!
